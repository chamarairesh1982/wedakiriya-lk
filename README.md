# WedaKiriya.lk

A simple static directory to showcase local services in Sri Lanka. Built with HTML, CSS and [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/). This repository is ready to be hosted on GitHub Pages.

You can view the live site at [https://chamarairesh1982.github.io/wedakiriya-lk/](https://chamarairesh1982.github.io/wedakiriya-lk/).

## Structure
- `index.html` – main page listing sample services
- `css/style.css` – custom styling
- `images/` – empty folder reserved for custom images (uses remote placeholders by default)
- `data/services.json` – sample data that could be used for future dynamic content

To preview locally, simply open `index.html` in a browser. No build step or server is required.

The service cards load example images from `https://via.placeholder.com`, so no images are stored in this repository. Add your own images inside the `images/` folder if desired.
